# kaggleWhale

Submission for the kaggle whale identification.
We identify using the tail of the whale. The resnet34 is
a preconfigured Deep learning network which has all but the last
layer frozen.
We use the training data classes and use it to test a set of images
and classify them in to a certain type of whale.
